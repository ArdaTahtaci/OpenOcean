-In this project I tried to make an NFT marketplace.

-This project is not finished yet. I wrote the smart contracts NFT.sol and Marketplace.sol and deployed them spolia testnet then made the home screen with react typescript (design is not mine, its a clone of deadrare nft marketplace on Alephium). I was stuck at uploding nft metadata to ipfs and then I didn't had time to proceed this project. This was my second dApp project.

Current version has screenshots at [/images] folder.
